# Contribution Guidelines

**New to GIT and GitHub?** See [these learning resources](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/) and this [10 min. GIT tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

Contributions to the project "Transition Spillovers? The Protest Behaviour of the 1989 Generation in Europe" are welcome. Participation is open: anyone can contribute using the standard processes on GitHub.

The repository contains documentation and code to reproduce the findings of Philippe Joly's paper (2019). The paper is currently under review: any suggestion to improve the analysis would be very appreciated.

## Reporting issues

- **Search for existing issues.** Please check to see if someone else has reported the same [issue](https://github.com/jolyphil/transition-spillovers/issues).


## Pull requests

I follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

**NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!**

- Fork the repo on GitHub
- Clone the project to your own machine
- Commit changes to your own branch
- Push your work back up to your fork
- Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes and keep them simple and small. If possible, squash your commits.
- Try to share how your code has been tested before submitting a pull request.
- If your PR resolves an issue, include **closes #ISSUE_NUMBER** in your commit message (or a [synonym](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages)).
- I will accept or comment on the PR.
- Once accepted your code will be merged to `master`.
